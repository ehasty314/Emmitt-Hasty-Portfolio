This was a class assignment for my Big Data Management Course. We were given a public law document, where we used the mapReduce paradigm in order to
do analysis on the words. I started by splitting each line of the document into each individual word, where I then mapped the words to a tuple (word, 1.)
I then sorted the tuples by count in descending order, which showed the number of times a word was used, with the most at the top. I took the top 10
words to ensure the data was correct. To then find the wordles, I filtered out the words which did not meet the 'wordle' criteria (wordles are 5 letters 
long, with no digits,) then with all of the wordles left in the data, I mapped the the wordles to the tuple (word, 1) and again sorted them by count in
descending order, again ensuring the data as correct with the top 10 values. The challenges with this assignment came with finding the wordles that began
and ended with the same letter, and finding the wordles where all 5 letters are distinct.
